# AWS-Cloud-Resume-Challenge

The [cloud resume challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a challenge by [Forrest Brazeal](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal) to help people to get started in the cloud industry.  

Companies of all sizes and industries use cloud technologies to boost efficiency, agility, and creativity. I prepared for [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) in 2023. AWS Certifications prove cloud computing expertise. I hoped these qualifications would increase my professional credibility, open new career doors, and help me flourish in my present work promoting AWS's value proposition. These certificates demonstrate my curiosity and drive to progress.
